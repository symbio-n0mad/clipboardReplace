# clipboardReplace.ps1

A lightweight PowerShell script for **search or search & replace operations** directly on your **clipboard content**.

---

## Basic Features
These are the core, productive features:

- Supports **inline strings** (`-search foo`, `-replace bar`) or **text files** (see below) as search/replace input  
- Includes a **grep-like search** mode (`-grep`) for quick text filtering 🔍  
- Optional **RegEx** mode (`-r`) and **case-insensitive mode** (`-i`)  



---
### Basic Examples  
Below are simple examples demonstrating the essential functionality of the script:

```powershell
# Basic inline search & replace
# Replaces every occurrence of "foo" with "bar" in the clipboard content.
clipboardReplace.ps1 -search "foo" -replace "bar"

# Grep-like filtering (no replacement)
# Keeps only lines that match "pattern" from the clipboard, holds terminal open until confirmation
clipboardReplace.ps1 -grep -searchText "pattern" -confirm

# RegEx + case-insensitive replacement
# Finds "foo...bar" regardless of case, and replaces the entire match with "baz".
clipboardReplace.ps1 -r -i -searchText "foo\d.*bar" -replaceText "baz"

```

##  Tip: Run via Keyboard Shortcut (Windows)

For quick access, it's highly recommended to run the script via a **custom keyboard shortcut** in Windows.  
You can achieve this easily using a **desktop shortcut** that launches PowerShell with the correct arguments.

###  Setup Steps

1. **Create a Shortcut**
   - Right-click on your desktop → **New → Shortcut**  
   - For the location, enter something like:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\clipboardReplace.ps1" -r -i -searchText "foo.*bar" -replaceText "baz"
     ```
     >  `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` ensures the script runs without restrictions, even if PowerShell’s default policy is limited.

2. **Assign a Keyboard Shortcut**
   - Right-click the newly created shortcut → **Properties**
   - In the **Shortcut** tab, click inside the *Shortcut key* field and press your desired key combo (e.g. `Ctrl + Alt + R`)
   - Click **Apply** or **OK**

3. **Use It**
   - Now you can simply press your shortcut to run `clipboardReplace.ps1` instantly — perfect for quick routine clipboard transformations or grep-style searches on the fly.

## Why PowerShell?

Why PowerShell? Simple: because it’s *already there*.  
Unlike many languages that would require extra installs or permissions, PowerShell comes preinstalled on (almost) every Windows system — including tightly locked-down enterprise environments.

In those settings, security policies often say:  
*"No, you can’t run that tool… no, you can’t install that… no, you can’t use that language…"*

And PowerShell just stands there, smiling politely like:  
**"Hehe, but *I* am allowed — here’s your solution."**

So while it may not be the flashiest choice, PowerShell is the one tool that actually survives the real-world security gauntlet. And that makes it the perfect fit for this project.
